"""Rain timing — when did it last rain, and when is the grass dry enough to mow.

`RainState` is the garden-owned aggregate (persisted via repository). It records
`rain_ended_at` — the timestamp of the last wet→dry transition (NOT a rolling
"last wet moment") — plus the `dry_hours` dry-out policy (user-configurable via
a number entity). `dry_at` derives the moment the grass is considered dry:
`rain_ended_at + dry_hours`. The planner clamps its mowing window so it never
starts before `dry_at`.

Replaces the legacy Jinja `input_datetime.luba_notify_mute_until` mechanism
(which stored the derived mute time and rolled it forward every 5 min). Here we
store the fundamental observation (rain end) and keep the policy (hours) explicit
and tunable.

    """Mutable aggregate — last rain-end + dry-out policy, persisted via repo.

    A DDD entity (behaviour + lifecycle + persisted), so a plain class with an
    explicit `__init__`, not a dataclass — the constructor takes only the
    reconstitution inputs (`rain_ended_at`, `dry_hours`; the fields `to_dict`
    round-trips), while the observation state is private and initialised
    internally.

    `rain_ended_at` is `None` until the first confirmed wet→dry transition
    (fresh install, or never rained since). Serialization: `datetime` via
    `isoformat`/`fromisoformat` (tz-aware, HA convention); `dry_hours` is plain
    float (Store persists JSON).

    `_is_wet` is the CONFIRMED wet state (drives the grass-wet sensor and the
    rain gate via `is_wet`), `_wet_since` is when the raw reading first turned
    wet, and `_last_wet_at` is the latest confirmed-wet moment (anchors `dry_at`
    WHILE it is raining — `rain_ended_at` still holds the PREVIOUS rain's end
    mid-shower). All three are TRANSIENT — re-derived from the weather entity on
    every observation, so they are deliberately excluded from `to_dict` (we
    persist the derived fact `rain_ended_at`, not the volatile observation).
